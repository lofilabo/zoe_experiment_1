NOTE for using gcc / cmake on Debian.

#gcc and cmake is not enough to install. Do this too:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential

#install ncurses library:
apt-get install ncurses-dev

#readline library does not seem to be installed on Debian.
#try this:
apt-get install libreadline6-dev
#or maybe this:
apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev
