Main File to Change:

tokenizer.h

Firstly:
cd Documents/01-cannot-harm/

To Compile:
cmake .
make

To Run:
./zoe ./000-New/003-numbers.zoe


NEXT TASKS:
* look at tokenizer.h   --  next changes are listed in there

* learn what these are for:
--	NUMBR
--	NUMBAR
--	TROOF
--	YARN
--	BUKKET
look at:

	https://github.com/leyarotheconquerer/lolcode-reference/blob/master/AdvancedReference.md
	to learn how array / BUKKET works

and:

	https://gist.github.com/tuanbaros/377b38de2876298e7dc31b67d526ede5

and don't forget 'original'

	https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md

NEXT RESEARCH:

		PROGRES!!

			This MAY BE completed....
			comments are:
			^.^ (one line)
			^.^{  	]Two or
			}^.^  	]more lines

				* how to change BTW
					----> grep -Rnw ./*.c -e 'BTW'
					we can see that BTW is defined in 
					./lexer.c:285:		if (!strncmp(start, "BTW", 3)) {

					NOTES ON __BTW__

					BTW [MESSAGE] 	To write a single line comment in LOLCODE, you use the BTW keyword. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are written for better understanding of the program.
					OBTW [MESSAGE]TLDR 	Similar to the BTW keyword, the OBTW keyword marks a multiline comment, a comment that spans multiple lines. 
					In LOLCODE, the OBTW keyword signifies the start of a multiline comment while the TLDR keyword ends it. 

						****NOTE!! IMPORTANT!!****

						'BTW' changed to 'zoeComment'
						at: ./lexer.c:285
				THIS IS NOT FINISHED
				BUT BEGUN.

				Next:
				Look at 
					OBTW
					and
					TLDR

And Then:

grep -Rnw ./*.c -e 'STDIO'
	which shows:
	STDIO is inside
	binding.c

So!
We need to look at:
lexer.c
and
binding.c
^^^^^^^^^-------This is also where 
		#include "unacceptable.h"
                                          is included!!

Finished here with:
	"zoe_+",      	/* TT_SUMOF */		/*  You Did This! 'SUM OF' -> 'zoe_+' */
	"zoe_-",     	/* TT_DIFFOF */		/*  You Did This! 'DIFF OF' -> 'zoe_-' */
	"zoe_*",  	/* TT_PRODUKTOF */	/*  You Did This! 'PRODUKT OF' -> 'zoe_*' */
	"zoe_/", 	/* TT_QUOSHUNTOF */	/*  You Did This! 'QUOSHUNT OF' -> 'zoe_/' */


NEXT TIME:
	TT_MODOF,       /**< Modulo. */
	TT_BIGGROF,     /**< Greater than. */
	TT_SMALLROF,    /**< Less than. */
	TT_BOTHOF,      /**< Logical AND. */
	TT_EITHEROF,    /**< Logical OR. */
	TT_WONOF,       /**< Logical XOR. */
	TT_NOT,         /**< Logical NOT. */
