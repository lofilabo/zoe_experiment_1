General walkthrough on making a library call.

i.	made header file unacceptable.h
ii.	made program file unacceptable.c
iii. modified CMakeLists.txt to include the files in the targets.

iv. made a function prototype in unacceptable.h, like this:
                int unacceptable_basis(int);

v.	implemented the function in unacceptable.c, like this:
                int unacceptable_basis(int j){
                	j++;
                	printf ("Unacceptable!\n");
                	return j;
                }
vi.	made sure that this line:
				#include "unacceptable.h"
	was present in unacceptable.c.  This is to make sure that the .h file is included to wrap up all of the <stdio.h> functions.

vii. made sure that this line:
				 #include "unacceptable.h" 
	was present in binding.c
	IMPORTANT NOTE: bindings.c needs to be able to see the function prototypes for unacceptable_basis.
	BUT: Directly including unacceptable.c will cause an //ld: 1 duplicate symbol// error.
	SO: Put function prototypes and library invocations in the .h header file, and #include that header file
	in the binding.c AND unacceptable.c file.

viii.added the function call to the library-invoking function in binding.c, like so:
	 int z = unacceptable_basis(4);
